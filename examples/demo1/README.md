This folder contains a bootable demo application for the MC1 computer.

## System requirements

## Build & Run

Run `make` to build the demo, which will produce `out/demo1.elf`. Then copy the
file to a FAT formatted SD card (be sure to call the target file `MC1BOOT.EXE`),

cp out/demo1.elf /path/to/sdcard/MC1BOOT.EXE
```

Insert the SD card into the MC1 computer and boot the computer.
